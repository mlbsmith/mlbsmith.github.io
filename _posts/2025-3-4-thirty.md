title: 30 for 30
---

This is a collection of the 30 books I found most interesting, impactful, or worth telling friends about. It's not necessarily a list of the 30 best books as I see it, because that would just descend into snobbery ("Oh, you haven't listed *all* Dostoevsky's work, do you even know how to read?"). These are the 30 books that mean the most to me in no particular order. Why 30? Well I recently turned 30 and planned to post this on my birthday (I was not even close to achieving that goal).

### A Gentleman in Moscow

I am absolutely a sucker for a witty, classy protagonist. Are they Russian? Even better. Beyond that, though, this is a story of finding meaning and of knowing what it is to be strong.

This book can be read lightly - it is funny and a bit silly at times - but it also reveals the consequences of oppression, corruption, and tyranny. And it shows how one person can fight back in their own small way.
