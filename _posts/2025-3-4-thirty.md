title: 30 for 30
---

This is a collection of the 30 books I found most interesting, impactful, or worth telling friends about. It's not necessarily a list of the 30 best books as I see it, because that would just descend into snobbery ("Oh, you haven't listed *all* Dostoevsky's work, do you even know how to read?"). These are the 30 books that mean the most to me in no particular order. Why 30? Well I recently turned 30 and planned to post this on my birthday (I was not even close to achieving that goal).

### Les Miserables

10 years ago, if you told me what this book was about without any context, I would be shocked to learn that it would turn out to be one of my all-time favourites. These books are intentionally not ranked, but if they were this one would have a strong case for number 1.

This is essentially a love story, but buried in the love story is a long arc of forgiveness and redemption. And if you get bored of that nonsense, there's a violent revolution, tales from the criminal underworld of Paris, and an extremely long yet fascinating digression on the Paris sewer system.

I cannot recommend this book enough. It is one of the best at capturing humanity at its most beautiful and tragic. This is the first story we should give to the aliens - I think it's our best chance at allowing them to understand us.

I recommend listening to the following playlist during/after reading:

### A Gentleman in Moscow

I am absolutely a sucker for a witty, classy protagonist. Are they Russian? Even better. Beyond that, though, this is a story of finding meaning and of knowing what it is to be strong.

This book can be read lightly - it is funny and a bit silly at times - but it also reveals the consequences of oppression, corruption, and tyranny. And it shows how one person can fight back in their own small way.
