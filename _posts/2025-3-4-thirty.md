title: 30 for 30
---

This is a collection of the 30 books I found most interesting, impactful, or worth telling friends about. It's not necessarily a list of the 30 best books as I see it, because that would just descend into snobbery ("Oh, you haven't listed *all* Dostoevsky's work, do you even know how to read?"). These are the 30 books that mean the most to me in no particular order. Why 30? Well I recently turned 30 and planned to post this on my birthday (I was not even close to achieving that goal).

### Les Miserables

10 years ago, if you told me what this book was about without any context, I would be shocked to learn that it would turn out to be one of my all-time favourites. These books are intentionally not ranked, but if they were this one would have a strong case for number 1.

This is essentially a love story, but buried in the love story is a long arc of forgiveness and redemption. And if you get bored of that nonsense, there's a violent revolution, tales from the criminal underworld of Paris, and an extremely long yet fascinating digression on the Paris sewer system.

I cannot recommend this book enough. It is one of the best at capturing humanity at its most beautiful and tragic. This is the first story we should give to the aliens - I think it's our best chance at allowing them to understand us.

I recommend listening to the following playlist during/after reading:

### A Gentleman in Moscow

I am absolutely a sucker for a witty, classy protagonist. Are they Russian? Even better. Beyond that, though, this is a story of finding meaning and of knowing what it is to be strong.

This book can be read lightly - it is funny and a bit silly at times - but it also reveals the consequences of oppression, corruption, and tyranny. And it shows how one person can fight back in their own small way.

### Lord Of The Rings

Perhaps no story holds the imagination of young children the same way. And it still hits hard re-reading it as an adult. This book is so foundational that I disqualified a few books and series from this list because they borrowed too many LOTR elements. It is the ultimate hero's journey and yet ends with a heavy melancholy. There is a simplicity to the story - none of this moral ambiguity nonsense that modern fantasy writers are always messing around with[^1] - but a darkness, too. Everything ends, and the horrors of war are sometimes too much for the heroes who end it.

It is also incredible that Tolkien invented a language first and *then* decided he needed a world to put it in. Arguably the most iconic fantasy world of all time wasn't even the author's primary goal.

[^1]:For the record I don't think moral ambiguity is all bad! But it does get exhausting sometimes. I just want to know who the bad guys are.
### Antifagile

Most of Taleb's books appeal to me - his writing is excellent - but this one felt the most practical. Black Swan was good, but I didn't connect with it the way I did with Antifragile. The combination of rigorous mathematics and ancient philosophy as applied to daily life hits all the right notes for me. 

It is an aspirational book. Taleb writes in hyperbole, but his points are good ones. We would all do well to try to structure our lives to benefit from disorder and volatility.
### Walden

Idealistic and Romantic. This book is best enjoyed slowly. If possible, over a week of camping or at a quiet cottage. The ideas Thoreau explores transcend living alone in a cabin in a woods. He touches on what it means to be comfortable in your own skin. And the magic of introspection in a world of rapid technological and political upheaval. Hard to believe he was complaining about the pace of change during an era without the telephone or cars. 

Honourable mention to another Thoreau essay here - the copy of Walden I have appends Civil Disobedience to Walden and it is an excellent read. After all the (possibly overdone) talk of abandoning civilization, it hits different when the author is willing to sacrifice their comfort and security for the improvement of said civilization.
### Dominion

There are some books that are a fun ride. When they end, you're happy you took the time to read them, but they don't linger. There's no aftertaste, good or bad.

This is not one of those books.

Regardless of how you feel about Christianity - and organized religion in general - this book will sit with you for a long time. It is one of the few books I've ever read that immediately changed how I see the world. The best way I can describe the feeling is: all your life you've thought you detected similarities between you and a group of people, then one day you find out you are actually related and share a direct ancestor, and it all makes sense. It's like that, and it turns out you're related to all people who grew up in "the West".

I promise you, no book will shape how you see human history like this.

### Brothers Karamazov

On any given day, I can identify with at least one of the three brothers. 

Ivan's tale of the Grand Inquisitor is the greatest story within a story of all time. And I don't think it's particularly close. Libraries have been filled with books analyzing that conversation between the two brothers. Don't read any of those. Just read the book yourself.

As an aside: when did people stop being afflicted by "brain fever"? A Dostoevsky novel would not be complete without a little brain fever. Is it a coincidence that so few writers have reached the heights of the great Fyodor? "Brain Fever In Novels Leads To Bestsellers: My Column"

### Man's Search For Meaning

There is no book, I think, that is more haunting and inspiring on a per word basis. I read this before visiting the [Memorial to the Murdered Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe) in Berlin. There are really no words fit to describe the horror, and the courage in the face of it.

### How To Live: A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer

The ultimate gateway to Montaigne. Full of interesting anecdotes from Montaigne's life. And it doesn't skimp on depth, either. Worth reading for anyone who thinks they know everything.
