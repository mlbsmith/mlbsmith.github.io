title: 30 for 30
---

This is a collection of the 30 books I found most interesting, impactful, or worth telling friends about. It's not necessarily a list of the 30 best books as I see it, because that would just descend into snobbery ("Oh, you haven't listed *all* Dostoevsky's work, do you even know how to read?"). These are the 30 books that mean the most to me in no particular order.
